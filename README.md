# Racing Game

## About the game
This is a simple racing game in which you must complete a loop before the time ends (you only have 2 minutes, so hurry up!).
Take advantage of the speed-ups and avoid being hit by two big rotating sticks. Will you be fast enough to conquer the castle?<br>

- If you jump, your car will turn red. After a few seconds, your car will turn white again. Then, you will be able to jump again.<br>
